# Contributing

## Golden rule
If it changes policy, doctrine, safety, privacy, money, or accreditation posture — it must be **reviewed** and **logged**.

## Workflow
1. Open an Issue (use templates)
2. Create a branch
3. Submit a PR that includes:
   - what changed
   - why it changed
   - what evidence supports the change
   - impact assessment (who/what it affects)
4. Review + merge by codeowners (when enabled)

## Versioning
- New documents start at `v1.0`
- Minor edits: `v1.1`, `v1.2` (clarity, small adjustments)
- Major change: bump major version and (recommended) board resolution

## Style
- Use `kebab-case` or `Title_Case` consistently per folder
- Put a “Revision History” section at the bottom of every policy document
