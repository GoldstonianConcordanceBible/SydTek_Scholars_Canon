# Curriculum Governance Overview (v1.0)

## 1) Purpose
This folder defines the curriculum backbone:
- scope and sequence (K–12)
- outcomes map (what “success” means)
- Hebrew Thread (cross-cutting progression)
- course catalog (HS) and syllabi templates (added in next chunk)

## 2) Non-negotiables
1. Every course/unit has outcomes, a plan, a rubric, and proof-of-learning artifacts.
2. Sequence is cumulative (skills build).
3. Worldview integration is explicit and measurable (rubric-based).
4. Evidence is versioned and reviewable (PR-based).

## 3) Change control
- Major changes to scope/sequence require:
  - rationale
  - impact notes (what breaks/what improves)
  - board notice if it changes mission-critical standards

## 4) Links to canon
- Curriculum spine: `../00-canon-governance/canon/chapters/CH-08_Curriculum-Spine.md`
- Assessment outcomes: `../00-canon-governance/canon/chapters/CH-10_Assessment-Outcomes.md`
