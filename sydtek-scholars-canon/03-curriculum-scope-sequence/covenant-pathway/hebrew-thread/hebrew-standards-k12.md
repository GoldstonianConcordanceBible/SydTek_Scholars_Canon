# Hebrew Thread — Standards K–12 (v1.0)

## 1) Purpose
Define a K–12 Hebrew progression that is measurable, age-appropriate, and integrated with Scripture literacy.

## 2) Band standards (starter)
### K–2
- recognize Hebrew letters (foundational set)
- connect basic sounds to letters
- learn a small set of meaningful vocabulary words (age-appropriate)

### 3–5
- improve letter recognition + basic reading practice
- grow vocabulary (thematic sets)
- demonstrate basic comprehension of learned words/phrases

### 6–8
- grammar foundations (basic forms)
- read short, guided selections (as appropriate)
- demonstrate comprehension through simple translations or summaries

### 9–12
- course-based progression (Hebrew I–III as offered)
- demonstrate proficiency with defined checkpoints
- interpret short passages with guidance (as appropriate)

## 3) Assessment approach
- proficiency rubrics with checkpoints
- portfolio artifacts (selected and privacy-safe)
