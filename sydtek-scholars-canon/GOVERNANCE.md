# Governance

## Authority structure
- **Board**: final authority for canon adoption, policy pack approval, and accreditation commitments.
- **Head of School / Director**: executes operations within board-approved boundaries.
- **Policy Owners**: maintain specific documents and implement updates through PRs.

## Governance rules (public-safe)
1. No major policy changes without a logged decision path:
   - Issue → PR → Review → Merge → (if major) Resolution
2. Every v1.0 policy has:
   - purpose
   - scope
   - roles/responsibilities
   - procedures
   - record/retention notes
   - revision history
3. Privacy boundary is mandatory:
   - public repo contains only stubs + SOPs for private records

## Public accountability

  - broken links
  - unclear claims
  - policy gaps
  - audit findings
