# Data Classification Standard (v1.0)

## 1) Purpose
Classify data so it is stored, shared, and protected correctly.

## 2) Scope
Applies to all documents and records in the program.

## 3) Classification levels
### PUBLIC
Safe to publish. Examples:
- policies, SOPs, templates (blank)
- high-level governance docs
- aggregated metrics (no identifiers)

### REDACTED
May be published only after identifiers are removed. Examples:
- sample student work (identifiers removed)
- incident summaries with all identifiers removed

### RESTRICTED
Private storage only. Examples:
- transcripts, grades tied to student identity
- testing results
- immunization records
- incident reports with names/identifiers
- private contact lists

## 4) Handling rules
- PUBLIC: may live in this repo
- REDACTED: may live here if a redaction checklist is used
- RESTRICTED: private storage only, access logged

## 5) Redaction checklist (minimum)
- Remove student name, ID, and any unique identifiers
- Remove location details beyond what is necessary
- Remove faces/images unless explicit permission and policy allow
- Confirm no indirect identifiers remain
