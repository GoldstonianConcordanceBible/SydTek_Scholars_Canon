# Access Control SOP (v1.0)

## 1) Purpose
Ensure sensitive records are accessed only by authorized roles and access is auditable.

## 2) Scope
Applies to RESTRICTED and REDACTED records.

## 3) Roles (starter)
- Head of School / Director
- Safeguarding Lead
- Records Custodian
- Faculty (limited access)
- Volunteers (no restricted access)

## 4) Minimum controls
1. Role-based access
2. Unique accounts (no shared logins)
3. Access logging for RESTRICTED records
4. Access review cadence (monthly or quarterly)
5. Immediate revocation upon role change

## 5) Procedure (public-safe)
- Grant access only after role verification
- Log:
  - who accessed
  - what category of record
  - when
  - why (brief)
- Review access logs on cadence
- Escalate anomalies as a potential privacy incident
