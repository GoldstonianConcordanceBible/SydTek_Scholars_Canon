# CH-12 — Graduation & Transcripts
**Status:** Draft (v0.1)  
**Purpose:** Define graduation requirements, transcript integrity rules, and records workflows (without publishing private records).

---

## 1) Purpose
Graduation and transcripts must be:
- honest and defensible
- consistent with documented requirements
- supported by evidence artifacts
- protected for privacy

## 2) Scope
Applies to:
- graduation requirements and credit definitions
- transcript generation and verification
- records requests and transfers
- storage and retention standards (private storage)

## 3) Core rules (non-negotiables)
1. Credits are awarded based on documented requirements and evidence.
2. Grades are tied to rubrics and artifacts.
3. Transcript changes require documented rationale and approvals.
4. Records are stored securely with access logs.

## 4) Graduation requirements (placeholder)
Graduation requirements are defined in:
- `03-curriculum-scope-sequence/course-catalog/graduation-requirements_v1.0.md` (later)

## 5) Transcript integrity
- No inflation for marketing.
- No unverifiable course titles.
- Course descriptions must match syllabus templates.

## 6) Evidence this chapter drives (folders/files)
- `03-curriculum-scope-sequence/course-catalog/*` (later)
- `06-student-records-private/*` (later, stubs)
- `13-nc-compliance/RECORDS-RETENTION_v1.0.md` (later)

## 7) Implementation checklist (Day 0–Day 60)
- [ ] Publish graduation requirements doc
- [ ] Publish transcript storage stub + access log template (private folder)
- [ ] Publish records request form (handbooks/forms)
