# CH-08 — Curriculum Spine
**Status:** Draft (v0.1)  
**Purpose:** Define the curriculum backbone: scope/sequence, outcomes map, and how units/courses are structured for repeatable quality.

---

## 1) Purpose
A curriculum spine prevents drift by defining:
- scope and sequence per grade band
- core domains (ELA, math, science, history, Bible literacy, etc.)
- unit structure and artifact expectations
- how worldview integration is applied consistently

## 2) Scope
Applies to:
- K–12 scope and sequence planning
- course catalog and syllabi templates
- unit planning templates
- release/versioning rules

## 3) Spine rules (non-negotiables)
1. Every course/unit has:
   - outcomes
   - learning plan
   - rubric
   - proof-of-learning artifacts
2. Sequence is cumulative (skills build).
3. Each grade band has a published cadence and minimum artifacts.

## 4) Unit structure (standard)
- Unit Title
- Outcomes
- Essential Questions
- Vocabulary (controlled)
- Lessons (weekly plan)
- Assessments (formative + summative)
- Artifacts (portfolio-ready)
- Rubric links

## 5) Evidence this chapter drives (folders/files)
- `03-curriculum-scope-sequence/overview.md` (later)
- `03-curriculum-scope-sequence/covenant-pathway/*` (later)
- `03-curriculum-scope-sequence/course-catalog/*` (later)

## 6) Implementation checklist (Day 0–Day 60)
- [ ] Publish K–2 scope/sequence
- [ ] Publish HS graduation requirements
- [ ] Publish course syllabus template pack
- [ ] Publish versioning standard (release packaging)
