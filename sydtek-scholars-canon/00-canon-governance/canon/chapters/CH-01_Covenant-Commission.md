# CH-01 — Covenant Commission
**Status:** Active Draft (v0.1)  
**Purpose:** Define the mission covenant, the public accountability posture, and the reason this program exists.

---

## 1) Purpose
SydTek Scholars exists to form students in truth, wisdom, skill, and service—under a covenant worldview—while operating with transparent, audit-grade documentation.

This chapter establishes:
- why the school exists
- what “covenant” means in governance and instruction
- how we prove integrity through receipts (evidence)

## 2) Scope
Applies to:
- board governance decisions
- curriculum decisions
- hiring expectations
- student/family commitments
- public communication standards

## 3) Definitions
- **Covenant:** A binding commitment to faithful practice and accountable conduct.
- **Receipts:** Public-safe evidence of decisions, standards, and implementation (not private records).

## 4) Mission (plain language)
We teach students to read well, reason clearly, live responsibly, and serve others—anchored in Scripture, disciplined learning, and measurable outcomes.

## 5) The Commission (non-negotiables)
1. **Truth over trend**: instructional and policy decisions must be anchored, documented, and explainable.
2. **Formation + competence**: character and skill develop together.
3. **Parent partnership**: families are co-stewards of learning.
4. **Audit-grade operations**: policies, minutes, and standards are versioned and reviewable.
5. **Privacy as stewardship**: student data is protected by design.

## 6) Accountability Model (public receipts)
We keep a public evidence trail:
- policies are versioned
- decisions are logged
- changes are reviewed
- major shifts map to board resolutions

This repo is designed to answer: “Show me how you operate.”

## 7) What this chapter requires downstream
This chapter drives creation of:
- `GOVERNANCE.md`
- `PUBLIC-CLAIMS.md`
- board minutes + resolutions folder
- evidence library indexing (later chapters)

## 8) Implementation checklist (Day 0)
- [ ] Create board roster template + bylaws template
- [ ] Create first resolution: adopt canon scaffold
- [ ] Add chapter stubs for CH-02 to CH-05 (titles + headings)
- [ ] Add initial board minutes template for the current month
