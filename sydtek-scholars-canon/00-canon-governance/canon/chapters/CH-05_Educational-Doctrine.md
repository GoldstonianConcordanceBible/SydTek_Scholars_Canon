## 1) Purpose
This chapter defines:

- how we ensure consistency across grades

## 2) Scope
Applies to:
- curriculum scope & sequence
- assessment approach

## 3) Educational commitments (non-negotiables)
1. **Literacy:** students learn to read, write, speak, and reason clearly.
2. **Mastery:** progression is earned through demonstrated competence.
3. **Formation:** character, responsibility, and service are practiced.
4. **Order:** learning is sequenced and cumulative.
5. **Support:** students are coached with clarity and structure.

## 4) Method (audit-friendly)
- Clear learning outcomes (per unit/course)

- Regular checks for understanding
- Portfolio artifacts (selected “proof of learning”)
- Transparent rubrics

## 5) Parent partnership
Families agree to:

## 7) Implementation checklist (Day 0–Day 45)
