# CH-14 — Operations
**Status:** Draft (v0.1)  
**Purpose:** Define operational standards: schedules, communications cadence, document control, and daily execution.

---

## 1) Purpose
Operations convert doctrine into consistent behavior by defining:
- daily/weekly rhythms
- documentation control rules
- communications cadence
- escalation pathways for issues

## 2) Scope
Applies to:
- staff operations and SOPs
- parent/student communications
- documentation and versioning
- service providers and vendor expectations (later)

## 3) Operating standards (non-negotiables)
1. If it matters, it gets documented.
2. If it changes policy, it gets reviewed.
3. If it touches safety/privacy, it gets escalated.
4. If it impacts families, it gets communicated clearly.

## 4) Document control
- Every policy has a version and revision history.
- Templates are clearly labeled.
- Major changes map to board decisions.

## 5) Communications cadence (default)
- Weekly: learning cadence note (family-facing)
- Monthly: outcomes + support summary (aggregated, public-safe)
- Quarterly: system improvement report (public-safe)

## 6) Evidence this chapter drives (folders/files)
- `01-policies-pack/operations/*` (later)
- `02-handbooks/*` (later)
- `10-annual-reports-change-logs/*` (later)

## 7) Implementation checklist (Day 0–Day 30)
- [ ] Publish operations attendance expectations (policy later)
- [ ] Publish documentation SOP (later)
- [ ] Publish incident escalation SOP (later)
