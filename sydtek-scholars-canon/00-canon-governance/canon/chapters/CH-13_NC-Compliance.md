# CH-13 — NC Compliance
**Status:** Draft (v0.1)  
**Purpose:** Define the compliance posture for operating a homeschool program in North Carolina, with documentation standards and audit readiness.

---

## 1) Purpose
Compliance protects families and students by ensuring:
- required records exist
- required processes are followed
- documentation is organized and retrievable
- private data is protected

## 2) Scope
Applies to:
- attendance documentation
- testing documentation (where applicable)
- records retention
- audit response behavior
- communications that reference compliance

## 3) Compliance approach (audit-friendly)
- Maintain a **plain-language summary** of requirements
- Maintain **templates** and **logs**
- Maintain **retention rules**
- Maintain a **response checklist** for audits

## 4) Public-safe boundaries
We do not publish:
- student attendance identifying logs
- student testing results
We may publish:
- blank templates
- aggregated totals (no identifiers)

## 5) Evidence this chapter drives (folders/files)
- `13-nc-compliance/*` (later)
- `01-policies-pack/privacy-records/*` (later)
- `10-annual-reports-change-logs/internal-audits/*` (later)

## 6) Implementation checklist (Day 0–Day 30)
- [ ] Add `13-nc-compliance/README.md`
- [ ] Add DNPE plain-language summary file
- [ ] Add attendance/testing template stubs (public-safe)
- [ ] Add records retention policy
