# CH-04 — Governance Doctrine
**Status:** Draft (v0.1)  
**Purpose:** Define how authority works, how decisions are made, and how disputes are resolved—document-first and audit-ready.

---

## 1) Purpose
This chapter defines:
- who has authority, and where it begins/ends
- how decisions are recorded
- how policy changes happen
- how conflicts are resolved

## 2) Scope
Applies to:
- board structure and responsibilities
- leadership delegation
- policy ownership and review
- incident escalation
- accreditation posture decisions

## 3) Governance principles (non-negotiables)
1. **Clarity:** roles and boundaries are written down.
2. **Receipts:** major decisions create artifacts (minutes/resolutions).
3. **Consistency:** similar situations are handled similarly.
4. **Review:** changes must be peer-reviewed.
5. **Correction:** errors are admitted, fixed, and logged.

## 4) Decision ladder
- **Tier 1 (Routine):** operational SOPs (Director + owners)
- **Tier 2 (Sensitive):** safety/privacy/finance impacts (Director + board notice)
- **Tier 3 (Major):** doctrine, accreditation posture, tuition model, safeguarding standards (Board resolution)

## 5) Required artifacts
- Minutes: `00-canon-governance/board/minutes/`
- Resolutions: `00-canon-governance/board/resolutions/`
- Claims policy: `PUBLIC-CLAIMS.md`
- Change log: `CHANGELOG.md` (when enabled)

## 6) Dispute resolution (public-safe summary)
- Step 1: document the concern (issue / complaint form)
- Step 2: review against canon/policy
- Step 3: decision + rationale documented
- Step 4: appeal pathway (if applicable) documented

## 7) Evidence this chapter drives (folders/files)
- `00-canon-governance/board/*`
- `01-policies-pack/operations/complaints-appeals-policy_v1.0.md` (later)
- `10-annual-reports-change-logs/*` (later)

## 8) Implementation checklist (Day 0–Day 30)
- [ ] Add bylaws template
- [ ] Add board roster template
- [ ] Add delegation of authority doc
- [ ] Add board cadence doc
