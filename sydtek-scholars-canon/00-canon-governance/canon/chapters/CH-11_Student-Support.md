# CH-11 — Student Support
**Status:** Draft (v0.1)  
**Purpose:** Define how students are supported academically and holistically, including interventions, accommodations boundaries, and escalation pathways.

---

## 1) Purpose
Student support ensures:
- students receive timely help
- gaps are identified early
- interventions are documented and consistent
- families are engaged with clear expectations

## 2) Scope
Applies to:
- tutoring and interventions
- learning plans (public-safe structure; private details stored off-repo)
- progress monitoring and communication
- referral and escalation processes

## 3) Support principles
1. Early identification beats late rescue.
2. Support is structured, not ad hoc.
3. Documentation is part of care.
4. Privacy is protected while systems remain auditable.

## 4) Support tiers (standard)
- **Tier 1:** Classroom supports (clarity, practice, feedback)
- **Tier 2:** Targeted interventions (small group, extra practice, tutoring)
- **Tier 3:** Intensive support (individual plan + coordinated follow-up)

## 5) Documentation (public-safe vs private)
**Public-safe:**
- intervention workflow
- templates (blank)
- aggregated outcomes

**Private:**
- individualized student details and records

## 6) Evidence this chapter drives (folders/files)
- `02-handbooks/forms/*` (records request, complaint, etc.)
- `04-assessment-outcomes/*` (progress monitoring)
- `06-student-records-private/*` (later, stubs)

## 7) Implementation checklist (Day 0–Day 45)
- [ ] Publish support tier workflow
- [ ] Publish intervention log template (public-safe)
- [ ] Publish family communication cadence (when/what)
