# CH-24 — Founders Covenant
**Status:** Draft (v0.1)  
**Purpose:** Define the founder commitments to integrity, truthfulness, stewardship, and accountability—binding the institution to the same standards it asks of others.

---

## 1) Purpose
This covenant exists to:
- formalize founder accountability
- prevent “do as I say, not as I do”
- protect families from mission drift
- protect the institution from ego-driven governance

## 2) Scope
Applies to:
- governance posture
- public claims and communications
- handling of money and conflicts
- commitment to audits and corrections

## 3) Founder commitments (non-negotiables)
1. **Truth:** no deceptive marketing, no inflated claims.
2. **Receipts:** keep documentation discipline; do not bypass process.
3. **Stewardship:** treat resources responsibly; publish clear policies.
4. **Protection:** prioritize safeguarding and privacy as sacred duties.
5. **Correction:** admit mistakes, log changes, and fix what is broken.
6. **Consistency:** accept the same standards applied to staff and students.

## 4) Governance humility clause
The founder agrees the Board holds final authority over major standards, and that policies exist to protect people—not personalities.

## 5) Evidence this chapter drives (folders/files)
- Board resolutions and conflict-of-interest policy (later)
- Public claims enforcement (already started)
- Internal audits (later)

## 6) Implementation checklist (Day 0–Day 30)
- [ ] Create conflict-of-interest policy and disclosure form
- [ ] Adopt founder covenant via board resolution (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Create public-safe roster and governance summary
