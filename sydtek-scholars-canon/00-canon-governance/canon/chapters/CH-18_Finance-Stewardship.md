# CH-18 — Finance & Stewardship
**Status:** Draft (v0.1)  
**Purpose:** Define financial integrity: tuition ethics, scholarship fairness, transparency posture, and related-party boundaries.

---

## 1) Purpose
Financial practices must be:
- honest and understandable
- fair and consistent
- documented and reviewable
- aligned with stewardship principles

## 2) Scope
Applies to:
- tuition rates and refunds
- scholarships and assistance
- budgeting and reporting cadence
- fundraising ethics (if applicable)
- conflicts and related-party transactions

## 3) Stewardship principles
1. Clear pricing and refund rules.
2. Scholarships follow documented criteria.
3. Budgeting is planned and reviewed.
4. Financial reporting is regular and board-visible.
5. Conflicts are disclosed and managed.

## 4) Transparency posture (public-safe)
We may publish:
- tuition schedule and refund policy
- scholarship policy and criteria
- aggregated summaries (no donor/student identifiers)
We do not publish:
- private family financial details
- donor identifying information (unless explicitly permitted)

## 5) Evidence this chapter drives (folders/files)
- `08-finance-stewardship/*` (later)
- `00-canon-governance/board/resolutions/*` (tuition, scholarships where major)
- `10-annual-reports-change-logs/*` (public-safe summaries)

## 6) Implementation checklist (Day 0–Day 60)
- [ ] Publish tuition and refund policy
- [ ] Publish scholarship policy + rubric
- [ ] Publish monthly finance reporting template (board-facing)
- [ ] Publish related-party disclosure form template
