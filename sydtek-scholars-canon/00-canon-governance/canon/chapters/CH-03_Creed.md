# CH-03 — Creed
**Status:** Draft (v0.1)  
**Purpose:** Define a clear, concise creed that unifies identity, expectations, and external communications.

---

## 1) Purpose
The Creed is a short statement that:
- anchors identity
- clarifies expectations for community members
- reduces ambiguity in decision-making and public communication

## 2) Scope
Applies to:
- staff/faculty onboarding
- student/family covenants
- public-facing “about” materials
- accreditation narrative consistency

## 3) The Creed (draft, minimal and readable)
We commit to:
1. **Truth** — we will not lie, manipulate, or misrepresent.
2. **Wisdom** — we will learn deeply and apply faithfully.
3. **Discipline** — we will do the work with integrity and consistency.
4. **Service** — we will use knowledge to bless others.
5. **Accountability** — we will keep receipts and correct course openly.

## 4) Creed in practice
- If a claim cannot be proven, it is not claimed.
- If a standard cannot be implemented, it is revised transparently.
- If an incident occurs, we respond with care, procedure, and documentation.
