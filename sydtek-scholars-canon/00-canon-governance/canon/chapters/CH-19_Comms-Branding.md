# CH-19 — Communications & Branding
**Status:** Draft (v0.1)  
**Purpose:** Define communications standards: claim integrity, family messaging cadence, crisis comms readiness, and brand consistency.

## 2) Scope
Applies to:
- website copy and enrollment messaging

## 3) Rules (non-negotiables)
1. Never claim accreditation unless granted and verifiable.
2. Never publish private student data.
3. Use consistent language across platforms.
