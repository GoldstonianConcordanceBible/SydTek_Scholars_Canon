# CH-06 — Public Accountability
**Status:** Draft (v0.1)  
**Purpose:** Define the “receipts-first” transparency model: what we publish, how we log changes, and how the public can audit without exposing private data.

---

## 1) Purpose
We operate with public accountability by maintaining:
- clear standards (canon + policies)
- logged decisions (minutes/resolutions)
- visible changes (changelog + “what changed” notices)
- privacy-safe evidence (no student personal data)

## 2) Scope
Applies to:
- documentation and publication rules
- change control and review standards
- audit response behavior
- communications about accreditation and compliance

## 3) What is public vs private
**Public (allowed):**
- standards, policies, templates
- aggregated metrics (no identifiers)
- minutes/resolutions (public-safe versions)
- audit findings and corrective actions (redacted)

**Private (never published here):**
- student records, transcripts, testing results
- immunization documents
- sensitive incident details with identifiers

## 4) Receipts model (how proof works)
- Every standard points to evidence artifacts.
- Evidence artifacts are public-safe or stubbed with instructions.
- Major changes produce a logged decision trail.

## 5) Public audit pathway
- Anyone can open an Issue:
  - audit finding
  - broken link
  - unclear claim
  - policy gap
- Maintainers respond with:
  - acknowledgement
  - timeline (if applicable)
  - corrective action PR

## 6) Evidence this chapter drives (folders/files)
- `ACCREDITOR-TOUR.md`
- `INDEX.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `10-annual-reports-change-logs/*` (later)
- `11-benchmarking/*` (later)

## 7) Implementation checklist (Day 0–Day 30)
- [ ] Add “What Changed” template (later folder)
- [ ] Add internal audit templates (later folder)
- [ ] Add public-safe scorecard template (later folder)
