# CH-20 — Legal & Risk Management
**Status:** Draft (v0.1)  
**Purpose:** Define risk management posture: incident handling boundaries, documentation rules, and escalation without giving legal advice.

---

## 1) Purpose
We reduce preventable harm by maintaining:
- clear policies and procedures
- documentation discipline
- escalation pathways for incidents
- privacy and safeguarding controls

## 2) Scope
Applies to:
- safeguarding and mandatory reporting alignment
- privacy/data incidents
- operational incidents (events, injuries, emergencies)
- complaints and disputes
- vendor and tool risk (privacy/security)

## 3) Risk principles
1. Preventive controls are better than reactive fixes.
2. Documentation is part of safety and integrity.
3. Escalate early when safety/privacy is involved.
4. Avoid informal side channels for serious issues.

## 4) Escalation posture (summary)
- Safety incident → follow safeguarding + emergency procedure docs
- Data incident → follow data incident response SOP
- Complaint/dispute → follow complaints/appeals policy
- Major risk change → board notice/resolution where applicable

## 5) Evidence this chapter drives (folders/files)
- `01-policies-pack/*` (safeguarding, privacy, complaints)
