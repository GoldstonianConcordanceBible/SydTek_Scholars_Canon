# CH-07 — Academic Model
**Status:** Draft (v0.1)  
**Purpose:** Define the academic operating model: schedules, instruction modes, mastery expectations, and consistency rules across grade bands.

---

## 1) Purpose
Define how learning actually happens:
- instructional model (async/sync/hybrid as applicable)
- weekly cadence and expectations
- how mastery is demonstrated
- how consistency is enforced across staff/courses

## 2) Scope
Applies to:
- curriculum delivery and pacing
- teacher planning expectations
- student workload expectations
- learning supports and interventions

## 3) Model (audit-friendly summary)
- **Plan:** outcomes + unit plan + rubric
- **Teach:** instruction + guided practice
- **Practice:** independent work + repetition
- **Check:** frequent formative checks
- **Prove:** summative artifact(s) and/or assessment
- **Support:** targeted help when mastery is not met

## 4) Cadence (default)
- Weekly schedule published per grade band
- Minimum learning minutes/hours (defined in operations/policies later)
- Clear submission + feedback windows

## 5) Mastery rule
- Mastery is demonstrated with rubrics and evidence (not vibes).
- Students can reattempt with coaching (bounded by policy).

## 6) Evidence this chapter drives (folders/files)
- `03-curriculum-scope-sequence/*`
- `04-assessment-outcomes/*`
- `02-handbooks/student-handbook/*` (later)

## 7) Implementation checklist (Day 0–Day 45)
- [ ] Publish weekly cadence for K–2 and 6–12
- [ ] Publish grading/mastery definitions (rubric set)
- [ ] Publish feedback SLA (e.g., return work within X days)
