# CH-02 — Judeo-Christian Foundations
**Status:** Draft (v0.1)  
**Purpose:** Establish the theological and philosophical foundations that guide governance, curriculum, and community conduct.

---

## 1) Purpose
This chapter defines the foundational commitments that shape:
- what we teach
- how we lead
- how we correct course
- how we measure integrity

## 2) Scope
Applies to:
- curriculum worldview integration
- staff/faculty expectations
- student/family partnership commitments
- policy interpretation when conflicts arise

## 3) Definitions
- **Worldview Integration:** aligning learning goals and practices to a coherent set of beliefs.
- **Stewardship:** responsible care of people, time, resources, and truth.

## 4) Foundations (high-level, audit-friendly)
We affirm:
1. Truth is objective and must be pursued honestly.
2. Scripture is a primary source for faith and practice in this institution’s identity.
3. Every student is made with dignity and is accountable for growth.
4. Wisdom is proven through consistent conduct and measurable progress.
5. Authority exists to protect and cultivate flourishing—not to dominate.

## 5) How this shapes schooling
- Education is formation + mastery.
- Knowledge is pursued with humility and rigor.
- Discipline is restorative and bounded by clear standards.
- Excellence is defined as faithfulness + competence.

## 6) Operating guardrails
- No policy may contradict these foundations without explicit board review and documented rationale.
- Public claims must be accurate, verifiable, and non-deceptive.

## 7) Evidence this chapter drives (folders/files)
- `02-handbooks/*` (covenants, affirmations)
- `01-policies-pack/*` (integrity, discipline, complaints)
- `03-curriculum-scope-sequence/outcomes-map/*`

## 8) Implementation checklist (Day 0–Day 30)
- [ ] Add staff faith affirmation (faculty handbook supplement)
- [ ] Add worldview integration rubric (outcomes map)
- [ ] Add “public claims” enforcement workflow (comms policy)
