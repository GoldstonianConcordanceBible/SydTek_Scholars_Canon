# CH-09 — Hebrew Thread
**Status:** Draft (v0.1)  
**Purpose:** Define the Hebrew Thread as a cross-cutting progression (K–12): what it is, why it exists, and how proficiency is measured.

---

## 1) Purpose
The Hebrew Thread is a structured progression that:
- connects language learning to Scripture literacy and cultural understanding
- builds progressively across grade bands
- is measured with clear proficiency rubrics

## 2) Scope
Applies to:
- Hebrew standards and progression documents
- course offerings (Hebrew I–III where applicable)
- integrated Bible literacy units

## 3) Thread definition (audit-friendly)
- K–2: recognition + sounds + simple words (age-appropriate)
- 3–5: basic vocabulary + reading practice
- 6–8: grammar foundations + short passages
- 9–12: structured coursework + proficiency goals

## 4) Proficiency approach
- Proficiency is measured through:
  - reading fluency checkpoints (age-appropriate)
  - vocabulary mastery
  - basic grammar/structure milestones (later grades)
  - demonstrated comprehension

## 5) Evidence this chapter drives (folders/files)
- `03-curriculum-scope-sequence/covenant-pathway/hebrew-thread/hebrew-standards-k12.md` (later)
- `03-curriculum-scope-sequence/covenant-pathway/hebrew-thread/proficiency-rubrics.md` (later)
- `04-assessment-outcomes/rubrics/Hebrew_Proficiency_Rubric.md` (later)

## 6) Implementation checklist (Day 0–Day 60)
- [ ] Publish Hebrew standards K–12
- [ ] Publish proficiency rubric(s)
