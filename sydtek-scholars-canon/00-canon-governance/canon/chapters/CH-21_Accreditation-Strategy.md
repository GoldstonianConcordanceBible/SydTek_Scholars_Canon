# CH-21 — Accreditation Strategy
**Status:** Draft (v0.1)  
**Purpose:** Define the accreditation posture: readiness-first documentation, honest claims, target selection criteria, and the self-study machine.

---

## 1) Purpose
Accreditation strategy here means:
- build a defensible system first
- map standards to evidence
- run internal audits
- communicate truthfully at all times

## 2) Scope
Applies to:
- accreditor targeting and selection
- self-study narrative preparation
- standards crosswalk creation
- evidence indexing and ownership assignments
- visiting team preparation (when applicable)

## 3) Accreditation posture (non-negotiables)
1. No premature “accredited” claims.
2. Evidence library is organized before application.
3. Gaps are logged and corrected, not hidden.
4. Self-study is a structured narrative with receipts.

## 4) Accreditor selection (criteria)
Minimum selection criteria:
- legitimacy and recognition
- scope (online/hybrid coverage)
- standards alignment with our model
- cost/time realism
- evidence expectations match our capacity

## 5) Evidence this chapter drives (folders/files)
- `09-accreditation/*` (later)
- `11-benchmarking/*` (later)
- `10-annual-reports-change-logs/internal-audits/*` (later)

## 6) Implementation checklist (Day 0–Day 90)
- [ ] Create accreditor shortlist doc
- [ ] Create standards crosswalk template
- [ ] Create evidence index + owner matrix
- [ ] Create gap scan template and run first scan
