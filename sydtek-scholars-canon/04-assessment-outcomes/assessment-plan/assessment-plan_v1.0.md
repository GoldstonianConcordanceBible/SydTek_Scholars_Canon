# Assessment Plan (v1.0)

## 1) Purpose
Define how learning is measured in a way that is:
- honest
- consistent
- improvement-oriented
- audit-ready

## 2) Principles
1. Assessments match outcomes (no busywork).
2. Formative checks drive support (not shame).
3. Summative checks prove mastery.
4. Portfolios provide evidence over time.
5. Integrity rules apply to all assessments.

## 3) Assessment types
- **Formative:** quizzes, drafts, practice checks, exit tickets
- **Summative:** exams, essays, projects, presentations, performance tasks
- **Portfolio artifacts:** curated proof samples across the year

## 4) Frequency (starter)
- Weekly: formative checks
- Monthly: portfolio selection (minimum 1 artifact)
- Quarterly: outcomes review + improvement actions
- Annually: program outcomes report (public-safe)

## 5) Evidence storage
- Student-identifying evidence is RESTRICTED and stored privately.
- Public repo contains rubrics, templates, and aggregated reporting.
