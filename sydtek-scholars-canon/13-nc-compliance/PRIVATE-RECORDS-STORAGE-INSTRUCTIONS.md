# Private Records Storage Instructions (Public-Safe)

This document explains how private records are stored without exposing student data.

## Storage goals
- Confidentiality (prevent unauthorized access)
- Integrity (prevent tampering)
- Availability (easy to retrieve when legitimately needed)
- Auditability (access is logged)

## Minimum controls
1. Role-based access (least privilege)
2. Access logging for sensitive records
3. Backups with recovery testing
4. Encryption at rest and in transit (where applicable)

## Storage options (choose one)
- Encrypted drive + locked folder permissions
- Secure cloud drive with role controls
- A student information system with audit logs

## Linking from this repo
- Do not link direct private URLs here.
- Use “storage reference IDs” (e.g., `PRIV-ATTEND-2026-02`) in private tracking docs.

## Required private docs (recommended)
- Access log (CSV)
- Storage map (where categories live)
- Incident response plan for data exposure (policy pack)
