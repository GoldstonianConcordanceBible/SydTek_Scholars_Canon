# NC DNPE Requirements — Plain-Language Summary (Public-Safe)

**Important:** This is a public-safe, plain-language summary for operational readiness.  
It is not legal advice. For definitive requirements, consult official NC sources and your own counsel.

## Compliance goals
1. Keep required records reliably and securely.
2. Maintain a consistent attendance recordkeeping practice.
3. Maintain standardized testing documentation where required/used.
4. Be able to respond to an audit or request with organized receipts.
5. Protect student privacy by default.

## Operational commitments (what we do)
- Maintain an attendance policy and an attendance tracking method.
- Maintain a testing policy and testing record template (blank).
- Maintain retention rules and storage procedures.
- Maintain an audit response checklist and monthly compliance memo cadence.

We publish:
- policies
