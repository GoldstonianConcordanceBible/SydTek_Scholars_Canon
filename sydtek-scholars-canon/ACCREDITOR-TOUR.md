# Accreditor Tour (5-Minute Rule)

If you only have 5 minutes, read these in order:

1) **Repo purpose & accountability**
- `README.md`
- `GOVERNANCE.md`
- `PUBLIC-CLAIMS.md`

2) **The Canon (core doctrine + operating model)**
- `00-canon-governance/canon/SydTek-Scholars-Canon_v1.0.md`
- Start of the chapter system:
  `00-canon-governance/canon/chapters/CH-01_Covenant-Commission.md`

3) **Board oversight**
- Minutes folder: `00-canon-governance/board/minutes/`
- Resolutions folder: `00-canon-governance/board/resolutions/`

## What you will NOT find here
- No student personal data
- No private addresses, immunization records, or confidential transcripts
- Instead: processes, templates, standards, and audit stubs

## How to validate integrity
- Check GitHub history (commits/tags)
- Confirm that major policy changes map to Board resolutions
- Confirm “What Changed” notes appear in CHANGELOG when enabled
