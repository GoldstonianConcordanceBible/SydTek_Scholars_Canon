## Rule

We do not “estimate” Cognia fees in accreditation evidence.
We only record:
- Publicly listed membership pricing (with a citation)
- Fees confirmed in writing by Cognia (with receipts stored in `00-membership/`)

---

## Public pricing snapshot (do not treat as a quote)

From Cognia’s membership page:
- Essential Membership (U.S.) shows $1,200
- Enhanced Membership (U.S.) shows $1,400
- Cognia notes additional fees apply during an Engagement Review year

**Citation stored in repo:** use the Cognia membership page link in `10-standards-alignment/SOURCE_REFERENCES.md`.
