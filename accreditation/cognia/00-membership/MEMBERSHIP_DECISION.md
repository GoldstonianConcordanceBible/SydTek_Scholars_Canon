**Document owner:** [[OWNER: Name, Title]]  
**Last updated:** [[DATE: YYYY-MM-DD]]  
**Status:** Draft / Final

---

## Purpose

This document records:
- Which Cognia membership level SydTek Scholars will use (Essential or Enhanced)
- Why the choice was made
- What is included/excluded (as confirmed by Cognia)
- A checklist of actions to complete membership onboarding

This prevents confusion later and provides an audit trail.

## Reference snapshot (public Cognia statements)

From Cognia’s membership page (verify your region + school type):
- Membership is listed as an **annual price per institution**
- **Essential Membership** lists **Performance Accreditation**
- **Enhanced Membership** lists **Performance Accreditation** and **Engagement Review*** (as a listed feature)
- The page displays **U.S. pricing** (Essential and Enhanced) and notes **additional fees apply during an Engagement Review year**

> DO NOT rely only on this snapshot. Confirm with Cognia in writing for SydTek Scholars’ institution type/location.

3. What are the **expected fees** in a non-review year and a review year?
4. Are there required platform trainings or timelines before scheduling a review?
5. Are there required policies/assurances to sign, and where should they be stored?
6. What evidence formats are preferred for the Engagement Review (portfolio structure, naming, etc.)?

## Onboarding checklist (do not mark complete unless you have proof)

- [ ] Submit membership application
- [ ] Receive confirmation of membership acceptance
- [ ] Confirm membership level + annual price in writing
- [ ] Confirm what is included/excluded in writing
- [ ] Create SydTek Scholars accreditation workspace and evidence folder map
- [ ] Assign internal owners for: Governance, Curriculum, Assessment, Data, Surveys
- [ ] Create initial improvement goals (1-year + 3-year)

## Risks + mitigations

### Risks
- Confusing “membership tools” with “accreditation review requirements”
- Underestimating review-year fees or timeline
- Evidence gaps (data, surveys, assessment documentation)

### Mitigations
- Keep every confirmation in writing in `00-membership/`
- Use the crosswalk to tag every artifact to standards
- Run monthly review memos for continuous improvement
