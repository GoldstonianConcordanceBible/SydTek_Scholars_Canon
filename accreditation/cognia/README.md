# Cognia Performance Accreditation — Evidence Library (SydTek Scholars)

This folder is the **Cognia-ready evidence library** for SydTek Scholars.

It is designed to support:
- Cognia **Performance Accreditation**
- A documented **continuous improvement system**
- Engagement Review readiness (evidence + analysis aligned to Cognia Performance Standards)

> Reference anchors:
> - Cognia Accreditation overview (Engagement Review reviews evidence against Performance Standards)
> - Cognia Membership levels (Essential vs Enhanced) and noted annual price ranges
> - Cognia Performance Standards key characteristics (Culture, Leadership, Engagement, Growth)
> - Cognia Accreditation & Certification Policies and Procedures (governing requirements)

## How to use this repo section

### 1) Start with membership + pathway
Go to:
- `00-membership/`  
Decide Essential vs Enhanced, document your decision, and log all membership communications.

### 2) Build your continuous improvement system
Go to:
- `20-continuous-improvement/`  
Create goals → measures → evidence → review cycle.

### 3) Align evidence to Cognia Performance Standards
Go to:
- `10-standards-alignment/`  
Use the crosswalk to tag every artifact by the relevant key characteristic(s).

### 4) Prepare for Engagement Review
Go to:
- `90-engagement-review/`  
Make an index of artifacts you will present, and a schedule/roles plan.

## Non-negotiables (minimum evidence posture)

SydTek Scholars will maintain, at minimum:
- A clear mission + learner outcomes + governance/decision rights
- Written curriculum maps and scope/sequence
- A documented assessment system (diagnostic/formative/summative) and how results drive action
- A simple dashboard of metrics tied to improvement goals
- Stakeholder surveys (parents/students/staff) and a “feedback → action” loop

---

## Naming + version control rules (for audit readiness)

**Do**
- Use dates in filenames where applicable: `YYYY-MM` or `YYYY`
- Use “CHANGELOG” entries for substantive changes
- Keep raw evidence and analysis separate (e.g., `surveys/results/` vs `surveys/analysis/`)

**Don’t**
- Put student-identifying information in this public folder
- Overwrite prior-year evidence; add a new year folder instead

---

## Evidence hygiene checklist

Each artifact should include:
1. Title + owner + last updated
2. Purpose (why it exists)
3. Where it maps to standards (key characteristic tags)
4. Where it is used in the improvement cycle (goal/metric/review)

## Placeholders you must fill

Search within this folder for:
- `[[FILL: ... ]]`
- `[[OWNER: ... ]]`
- `[[DATE: ... ]]`

## Source references (for your audit binder)

and cite the Cognia pages/pdfs you used to build your framework.
